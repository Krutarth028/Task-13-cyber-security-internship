# API Security Testing Report – Task 13

## Tool Used
- Postman

## APIs Tested
- https://reqres.in
- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

## Tests Performed
- Authentication testing
- Authorization (ID manipulation)
- Input validation
- Rate limiting observation
- HTTP response analysis

## Observations
- GET requests returned 200 OK for valid resources
- Login endpoint on Reqres returned 403 Forbidden due to server restrictions
- Authentication was simulated using a public test API
- Invalid user IDs returned empty or error responses
- API accepted unexpected input values
- No rate limiting was observed during rapid requests

## OWASP API Risks Identified
- API2: Broken Authentication
- API5: Broken Authorization
- API8: Security Misconfiguration

## Conclusion
The APIs demonstrate basic security controls, but weaknesses were observed in input validation and rate limiting.
